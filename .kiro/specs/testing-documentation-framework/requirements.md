# Testing and Documentation Framework Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a comprehensive testing and documentation framework for the Kaspa All-in-One package. The framework must ensure reliable installation across different environments, provide thorough user guidance, and maintain high code quality through automated testing.

## Requirements

4. WHEN testing different hardware configurations THEN the system SHALL verify compatibility with minimum and recommended specs
5. IF any installation step fails THEN the system SHALL capture detailed logs and error information
6. WHEN network connectivity varies THEN the system SHALL test installation under different network conditions

### Requirement 2: Service Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want confidence that all Kaspa ecosystem services work together correctly, so that I can rely on the system for production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all services are running THEN the system SHALL verify Kaspa node synchronization within expected timeframes
2. WHEN Kasia indexer starts THEN the system SHALL confirm it can connect to and index from the local Kaspa node
3. WHEN K Social indexer starts THEN the system SHALL verify it processes social data correctly
4. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display accurate real-time data from all services
5. IF any service fails THEN the system SHALL test automatic restart and recovery mechanisms
6. WHEN services communicate THEN the system SHALL validate all inter-service API calls work correctly

### Requirement 3: Performance and Load Testing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to understand the performance characteristics and resource requirements, so that I can properly size hardware and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs under normal load THEN performance tests SHALL measure CPU, memory, and disk usage baselines
2. WHEN the Kaspa node syncs THEN the system SHALL measure and document sync time and resource consumption
3. WHEN multiple users access services THEN load tests SHALL verify system stability under concurrent usage
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN tests SHALL verify graceful degradation behavior
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide alerts and diagnostic information
6. WHEN benchmarking completes THEN the system SHALL generate performance reports for different hardware configurations

### Requirement 4: User Documentation System

**User Story:** As a new user, I want comprehensive, easy-to-follow documentation that guides me through hardware selection, installation, and operation, so that I can successfully deploy the system without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users need hardware guidance THEN documentation SHALL provide specific mini-PC recommendations with price ranges
2. WHEN users start installation THEN documentation SHALL include step-by-step guides with screenshots
3. WHEN users encounter issues THEN documentation SHALL provide troubleshooting guides with common solutions
4. WHEN users want to customize THEN documentation SHALL explain configuration options and their impacts
5. IF documentation becomes outdated THEN the system SHALL have processes to keep content current with code changes
6. WHEN users search for help THEN documentation SHALL be searchable and well-organized

### Requirement 5: Developer Documentation System

**User Story:** As a developer contributor, I want detailed technical documentation about the system architecture and development processes, so that I can effectively contribute to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers need architecture information THEN documentation SHALL provide system diagrams and component relationships
2. WHEN developers want to contribute THEN documentation SHALL include coding standards and contribution guidelines
3. WHEN developers modify services THEN documentation SHALL explain API contracts and integration points
4. WHEN developers add features THEN documentation SHALL guide them through testing and validation processes
5. IF architecture changes THEN documentation SHALL be automatically updated through code annotations
6. WHEN developers debug issues THEN documentation SHALL provide debugging guides and common patterns

### Requirement 6: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated build, test, and release processes that ensure code quality and reliable deployments, so that releases are consistent and trustworthy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN CI/CD SHALL automatically run all test suites
2. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL build and push Docker images to registries
3. WHEN creating releases THEN the system SHALL automatically generate release notes and version tags
4. WHEN security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL alert maintainers and block releases
5. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent merging and provide detailed failure reports
6. WHEN releases are created THEN the system SHALL automatically update documentation versions

### Requirement 7: Quality Assurance Framework

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing tools and processes that catch issues before they reach users, so that the system maintains high reliability standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN QA tools SHALL run static analysis and security scans
2. WHEN Docker images are built THEN the system SHALL scan for vulnerabilities and compliance issues
3. WHEN services start THEN health checks SHALL verify all components are functioning correctly
4. WHEN system runs over time THEN monitoring SHALL track performance trends and detect anomalies
5. IF quality metrics decline THEN the system SHALL alert maintainers with actionable information
6. WHEN releases are prepared THEN QA SHALL provide comprehensive test reports and sign-off

### Requirement 8: Documentation Maintenance and Versioning

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want automated processes that keep documentation synchronized with code changes and provide version-specific guidance, so that users always have accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code APIs change THEN documentation SHALL be automatically updated or flagged for review
2. WHEN new versions are released THEN documentation SHALL maintain version-specific installation guides
3. WHEN configuration options change THEN documentation SHALL reflect new parameters and deprecations
4. WHEN users report documentation issues THEN the system SHALL have processes for quick updates and validation
5. IF documentation links break THEN automated checks SHALL detect and report broken references
6. WHEN documentation is updated THEN changes SHALL be reviewed and approved before publication

### Requirement 9: Open Source Governance and PR Management

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want robust governance processes that ensure code quality, security, and community collaboration while maintaining project integrity, so that the open-source project remains sustainable and trustworthy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN contributors submit PRs THEN the system SHALL require automated checks to pass before review
2. WHEN PRs are submitted THEN the system SHALL require at least two maintainer approvals for core changes
3. WHEN security-sensitive changes are made THEN the system SHALL require additional security review and approval
4. WHEN breaking changes are proposed THEN the system SHALL require RFC process and community discussion

6. WHEN maintainers are unavailable THEN the system SHALL have clear escalation and emergency procedures

### Requirement 10: Repository Administration and Security

**User Story:** As a repository administrator, I want comprehensive security controls and administrative processes that protect the project from threats while enabling productive collaboration, so that the project maintains its integrity and reputation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users contribute THEN the system SHALL enforce signed commits and verified identities
2. WHEN sensitive operations occur THEN the system SHALL require multi-factor authentication
3. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically scan for vulnerabilities and license conflicts
4. WHEN releases are created THEN the system SHALL require cryptographic signing and verification
5. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically lock accounts and alert administrators
