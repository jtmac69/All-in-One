## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Service Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one clear purpose
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate via well-defined APIs
- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality is grouped together
- **Fault Tolerance**: Services handle failures gracefully

### Docker Best Practices

- Use multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Run containers as non-root users
- Include health checks
- Use specific image tags, not `latest`
- Minimize layers and image size

### Security Considerations

- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper input validation
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated

### Release Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated
